# *Using the  Conjugate gradient method to solve the Poisson's Equation in OpenMP*
---
## 1. Introduction
Conjugate gradient method is an algorithum method to solve a large system of _linear equations_.
In this project, we use this method to solve a simple Poisson's equation problem. 
To increase the efficiency of the process, we use the OpenMP to calculate some difficult steps in parallel.
## 2. Technologies
* C++
* OPENMP
Project is created with:
* T110E5, jsp: Create the first version and second version of CG method.
* Kuo-Jui: Do the final edition and add the parallel parts.
